# Best practices for Data Scientists using Python

## Background

* All the participants are Data Science people with Msc or Phd
* Principles of correct and performant coding.
* Design Patterns.
* Clean code.
* Effective code.
* Object oriented vs functional.
* Profiling and optimization of numpy and pandas code.
* Code-review BKMs.


## Questions and notes

* Are the people using git or some other vesrion control system? How familiar are they with it?
* Are people writing Jupyer notebooks only or are they writing libraries as well?
* What is considered "production" for them?
* What is the outcome of their work? Working code? A graph?
* How important is making the analyzis repeatable? On the same dataset. On another dataset?

* Code layout - black
* Linters: flake, pylint?

* Which libraries do they use besided numpy and pandas?
* Do they have requirements.txt file or other way to specify the list of libraries they use?
* Do they use virtualenv or some other tool to separate environments?
